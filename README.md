## Objective:
Help the bike company understand when and how they generate the most revenue and whether they can raise prices in the future

## Process:
- Built a database and queried the data using SQL.
- Connected Power BI to the database
- Designed an interactive dashboard with key metrics

## Key Insights:
- Identified the most profitable hours of the day.
- Analyzed seasonal and yearly revenue/profit trends
- Explored rider demographics (casual vs registered)

## Business Question Answered:
“Can we raise prices next year?” Based on the data, the answer is yes — revenue and riders increased even after a price hike

## Recommendation:
A slight increase in price can be implemented without reducing customer demand
